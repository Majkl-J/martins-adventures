# martins-adventures
A game developed solely by me. The original Martin promised music.

## What is this game about
This is a small game about my friend Martin's adventures. It is full of bad inside jokes and Roombas.

## Current plans
This part will discuss what to expect later.
### Mechanics
  - Actual attack, probably makes a new object with collider
### Enemies
Currently need to add:
  - Working roomba enemies (Currently under work)
  - Stronger enemy, probably with a simple easy to understand weakspot
  - Projectile enemy
  - Boss Franz to end the first chapter
### Ambient
Interactive pieces of enviroment.
  - Breakable vents
  - Crates
  - Big boom barrels
### Items
These will be very important but should stay simple and straight to the point.
  - Healing item (Chalk?)
  - Simple powerup that lasts until hit, then gets dropped able to be collected again. (shoes?) (gives projectile attack?)
### Levels
Levels would be grouped into chapters. Each chapter would have a specific theme.
  - Add 2 playable levels
  - Add more test levels
### Cheats
Probably thru a simple console.
  - Level changer cheat (Important for debuging)
  - Invincibility cheat
  - No powerup drop
  - Heal
  - Powerup give
